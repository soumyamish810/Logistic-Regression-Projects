# Predicting Ad Click Behavior with Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project explores a classification task using a synthetic advertising dataset. The goal is to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their demographic information and online behavior metrics such as time spent on site, internet usage, and more.

Using Python and machine learning, this project walks through an end-to-end workflow:
- Data Exploration (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building with Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with metrics and confusion matrix

## Dataset Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Daily Time Spent on Site` | Time user spends on the website (in minutes) |
| `Age` | Age of the user |
| `Area Income` | Average income of user’s geographical location |
| `Daily Internet Usage` | Average daily internet usage (in minutes) |
| `Ad Topic Line` | Headline of the ad |
| `City` | User’s city |
| `Country` | User’s country |
| `Male` | Gender flag (1 = Male, 0 = Female) |
| `Timestamp` | Time when ad was clicked or page was closed |
| `Clicked on Ad` | Target variable (1 = Clicked, 0 = Not Clicked) |

 Technologies Used
 
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for EDA and visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)
